# Java 2D Text-Based Game

**Project currently under development.**
This is a project of a completely text based game, that is, a game completely made by code using Java with a *JDK 9*. It has a quite complete documentation about absolutely all variables, methods, classes and  all variables, methods, classes and packages that belong to it. See here the complete documentation: ![Index](uml/Documentacion/index.html)

Thanks for taking a look at this project!

This is a 2D top-down game where a player (with a main character named Keit) must  a world which is full of puzzles, enemies and different obstacles to overcome in order to win. My main goal of this project is to share the most fundamental basics of video game development.  of videogame development. This is because, in this code you will have to deal with *Update* functions (functions called in each frame), *Sprites* (16 x 16 images), *Animations* (the ones that control the animations), among others.

This was a project created as inspiration in The Legend Of Zelda(1986), for the subject **Programming in Java** of the *Universidad Nacional de Colombia sede Manizales*. Visit my page [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luis-carlos-botero-agudelo-ab8896175/) for more samples of projects made in Unity, Unreal Engine, Java, among others for different technologies such as 2D, 3D, Virtual Reality, Augmented and Extended games.

The technologies we use are Java **(JDK 9)**, I recommend using Intellij IDEA as the main text editor to be able to download and use all the necessary libraries. libraries needed. Although if you feel comfortable using another text editor such as Visual Studio Code, feel free to do so. A basic knowledge is required to be able to develop this kind of knowledge is required to be able to develop this kind of projects, such as object oriented programming, classes, extensions, among other basic factors of programming development. programming. For more information on this, I recommend reading [Java Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/java/) to learn the basics.

## States and Prerequisites

Current development states
```
Java : JDK 9
Platforms : Intellij IDEA
```
## Getting the project

To get the project you must clone it.
>__IMPORTANT__:
> This is a project made on Java Intellij IDEA with the specific libraries mentioned above. 
> > It is not any launcher to play the project, otherwise this.
> **Will not work**. To install Intellij IDEA I recommend [see](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MoR2Us4HKEP-TjAl7YXJlZC4dbbFwxr1/view)

The project weighs approximately 1.94MB, despite being small, make sure you have sufficient storage requirement for download and use 
(at least double the storage).


### Running the project

Once the project is opened, the main usage file (main class) is the one that will perform all the debugging and usage of the project.
It is recommended to read [Main Class](uml/Documentacion/main/Main.html)
